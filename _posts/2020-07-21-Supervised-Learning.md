For deep learning, there are severals ways how the learning can be processed. Here we put a new tag on how a POC or a algorithm learning from the [dataset]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dlcv2/Dataset/) with the 4 categories as below:

### Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
### Semi-Supervised Learning
### Reinforcement Learning
